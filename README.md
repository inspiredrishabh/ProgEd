# ProgEd
"ProgEd" is my frontend project, a course-selling website offering Java, C++, and PHP courses. It incorporates numerous animations, including floating windows and cursor effects. The animation technologies utilized in this project are GSAP and Locomotive, both of which I implemented myself.
